 BizzThemes Theme Root Directory

 ## QUICK OVERVIEW

 Theme consists of two separate libraries that interact witch each other, but are separated
 due to updating purposes. 
 
 lib_theme library:
 ------------------
 Contains all files that are specific for this particular theme 
 and cannot be used in other bizz themes by simple copy-pasting. Modifying these files is not recommended
 and in case you want to modify any of its files, add new scripts, images or change styles,
 you should consider using 'custom' folder (find it in theme root directory) for that purpose.
 
 lib_frame library:
 ------------------
 Contains all files that are used as theme backbone and power the overall
 theme performance. Without these files theme will not work, so any code change or file 
 removal will result in theme not functioning properly. We strongly recommend you to leave
 this folder intact.
 
 ## SUMMARIZED INSTRUCTIONS
 
	* USE Custom Editor in theme administration for customizing purposes
	    * EDIT custom/custom_functions.php to add, modify or delete theme functions
	    * EDIT custom/custom.css to modify theme design manually
	    * DO NOT EDIT custom/layout.css to modify theme design, file is modified automatically
